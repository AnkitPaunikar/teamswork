## Teams Work

#Vision:
To reduce the waste of time of team when interaction with each hierarchy in a project structure and making team members well aware and clear on the discussion and decision between upper management and client.

#Overview:
The Teams Work application is being developed to address the challenges faced by project managers and team members working across multiple projects. It is designed to streamline communication, collaboration, and raise sprint risk to management for better handling of project/The tasks. The application will enable project managers to efficiently oversee teams and monitor risk communication between team members and client, So that does not impact sprints delivery and lack of communication between any team member, while also providing team members a clear way of communication, scheduling, and flagging loose ends from there side.

#The Application current state
1. Dashboard
   After login, the Dashboard will be the first screen displayed for all users.
   The dashboard will be role-based, meaning different roles (e.g., Admin and User) will have different permissions and functionalities.
   ADMIN:
   The Admin (e.g., Project Manager/Product Owner) will have the ability to create and manage projects.
   USER:
   The User will not have access to create projects. They will only see the projects they are assigned to and can manage their tasks within those projects.
   This ensures that project management responsibilities are handled by the Admin, while Users can user other functions in the application.
